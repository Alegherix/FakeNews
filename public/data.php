Richard is taunted by his work colleagues, especially over his 'Pied Piper' app, a music copyright checker. However, when the curious Hooli engineers discover that his app contains a very powerful file compression algorithm, a bidding war begins. Richard finds himself caught between a $10 million buyout by Hooli CEO Gavin Belson, and a $200,000 investment from eccentric billionaire Peter Gregory.",

At a lavish toga party hosted by Peter Gregory, Richard gets drunk and haphazardly offers Erlich a seat on the Pied Piper Board of Directors. Meanwhile at Hooli, the other engineers on the Nucleus team finally realize that Big Head has absolutely no knowledge of Pied Piper's compression algorithm. Subsequently, Big Head finds himself removed from the Nucleus project. However, he is not assigned to any new project, so he begins to spend his days on the roof eating snack food with the other Hooli employees who are 
        'unassigned'."
