Richard is taunted by his work colleagues, especially over his 'Pied Piper' app, a music copyright checker. However, when the curious Hooli engineers discover that his app contains a very powerful file compression algorithm, a bidding war begins. Richard finds himself caught between a $10 million buyout by Hooli CEO Gavin Belson, and a $200,000 investment from eccentric billionaire Peter Gregory. After having a panic attack and vomiting on the street, Monica, Peter Gregory's assistant, convinces Richard that he should maintain control of his company and simply take Peter's offer of an investment.",

At a lavish toga party hosted by Peter Gregory, Richard gets drunk and haphazardly offers Erlich a seat on the Pied Piper Board of Directors. Meanwhile at Hooli, the other engineers on the Nucleus team finally realize that Big Head has absolutely no knowledge of Pied Piper's compression algorithm. Subsequently, Big Head finds himself removed from the Nucleus project. However, he is not assigned to any new project, so he begins to spend his days on the roof eating snack food with the other Hooli employees who are 
        'unassigned'."

After a round of awkward lawyer aided negotiation Gavin's lawyers agree to drop the lawsuit and settle for binding arbitration. Pete Monahan, a disbarred lawyer, agrees to represent Richard on spec because he is no longer allowed to practice law in a real court due to suspected sex crimes. Monahan interviews Richard and reveals that Richard had indeed used a Hooli computer to run a short test of Pied Piper while his personal laptop was being repaired, meaning that Hooli would own the rights to Pied Piper. Their only hope is that the Hooli lawyers do not discover this fact, and initially they do not, as they seem to be centering their case on establishing Big Head as a capable engineer who had a hand in Pied Piper. However, when Erlich is put on the witness stand he inadvertently reveals that Richard's laptop was in the shop being fixed, giving the necessary clue to the opposition. Richard, who is unwilling to lie under oath, finally admits that he used a Hooli computer. Meanwhile, due to low viewership, a technician is sent to take down the condor egg camera. However, he falls and becomes trapped in a ravine, and it is all live-streamed on Pied Piper's system.",

However, the Pied Piper team is disappointed after seeing that the Nucleus team has developed an app with a 'Weissman' compression score of 2.89, which is a similar score than their own. Dejected, the team heads back to their hotel room, where they randomly begin to mock up a mathematical model for Erlich to give handjobs to every male in the audience. After Richard takes in the beginning of the discussion, he seems to reach an epiphany and retreats into his room to begin coding. By the next morning Richard has completely rewritten parts of the Pied Piper app, however the rest of the team is completely unaware of what he has done. Richard does the presentation, slowly revealing that he has developed a new method of compression, named 'middle-out', and demonstrates that he has achieved an astronomical Weissman score of 5.2. Pied Piper wins the Battlefield, and an embarrassed Gavin Belson walks away quietly.",

The two most notable candidates are Jared Patakian, an eccentric man who labels himself as a cyborg, and Carla Walton, a friend of Dinesh and Gilfoyle. With the introduction of Jared Patakian, Jared Dunn is renamed 'Other Jared', which is often shortened to 'OJ'. Other Jared hires Carla, awkwardly tries to explain that it's better to hire her because she's a woman, and tries to enforce company human resources policies. Erlich discourages Richard from hiring Jared Patakian because he chose a different job just as Erlich was about to hire him at Aviato, and Carla tortures Gilfoyle and Dinesh by making them think she makes way more money than them. Additionally, Pied Piper has a meeting of the Board of Directors at Hanneman's house. Hanneman gives his girlfriend a seat on the board, and Erlich turns against Richard to vote to order $30,000 worth of merchandise. Later, Richard decides to hire Jared despite Erlich's disapproval, but quickly finds out that Patakian has done the exact same thing to him as Patakian did to Erlich. Simultaneously, Belson promotes Big Head to be Co-head Dreamer on the Hooli XYZ project with the intention of making him seem like the primary force behind Pied Piper, and thus evidence for his lawsuit. Big Head is given a massive office and an assistant, but suspiciously no responsibilities, while Davis Bannercheck, a pioneer of robotics, is named the other Co-head Dreamer and leads operations at the lab.",
