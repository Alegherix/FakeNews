(Jonathan)Review:
1. Nice and clean design, maybe the 'Breaking news' and 'Trending' letters could be a bit smaller.
2. The usage of fonts could be slightly more varied, for instance you could further distinguish the font's type/color/size between 'Written by', the date of publishing and the main content of the articles.
3. Maybe a footer of some sort
4. The workability on mobile is good, though when in mobile mode you lose access to the menu, maybe a burger could work?
5. Great work, I like it!

(Hugo Sundberg)Review: 
1. Styling would be more easily read if it were split up in several files and possible commented. 
2. A lot of the values currently set in 'px' could be set in 'rem' to make it easier to work with for responsivity and for accessability
3. Seagull SVG is sexy
4. Variable cardContainer in script.js:14 would be better named cardContent to match purpose and css-class
5. Some comments begin with upper case and some begin with lower case. Get your shit tog0ether.
